WORST CASE

In comb sort, the big O worst case would be quadratic (O(n^2)), because in the worst case, it would be the 
same as bubblesort, making the same amount of switches as in bubblesort. Both of them goes through
the list one by one and compares two numbers, and in the worst case, it would switch all of the 
numbers and go back again to go through the process again, ultimately having the same function as 
bubblesort but just with a gap in between.

The comb sort would switch through the 1st loop 1 time with a gap of n-1, then go
back and set the gap smaller, now switching 2 times, until finally 
it runs n-1 times when the gap becomes 1. It would be the same as bubblesort 
because bubblesort switches through the first loop n-1 times, then n-2 times, until 
finally going switches the loop 1 time. This is basically the combsort backwards, therefore
the big O worst case would be the same.
