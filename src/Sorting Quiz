Sorting quiz written portion.


In comb sort the worst case is O(n^2), this is due to the fact in its similarity to bubble sort, that the
number of times that it will run, will be the same as bubble sorts worst case. In the best case 
however these two can be different in that comb sort will not run as many times through as comb sort does.

So in this case comb sort's notation for the big ) is O(n^2).
