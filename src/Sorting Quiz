therefore, it's O(n^2), since the nested loops are resulting in the inner loop being activated an
    x amount of times, n amount of times (where n depends on the size of the array). Since this x value
    depends on the n value, where the "n.length" condition is reached only based on the size of the array
    AND the resulting gap of each run through, which is once again determined by the initial n value,
    the overall expression can be approximated to O(n*n), or O(n^2)
