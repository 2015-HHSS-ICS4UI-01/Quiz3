Worst case = reverse order

In the worst case, comb sort is = O(n^2) because the method would have to run through n number of loops for each gap, and n checks within each gap loop.

overall, thats n number of gap loops, and n checks within the n loops which is equal to n^2

in other words, each individual gap loop is the same as the best case scenario for bubble sort which is O(n)
O(n) must then run n times to account for each gap loop, leading to the O(n^2).
