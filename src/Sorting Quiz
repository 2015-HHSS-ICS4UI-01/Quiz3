Big O of N: Because the while loop will not run as many times as the for loop, which will run an amount of times being n
                Where the while loop only needs to run until the value of gap is one and then once it has had no more swaps
                There fore the for loop will need to run a much larger amount of times where as the while loop may only need
                to be ran 6 times in comparison to that of the 8 times that the for loop was ran, therfore the big O notation
                is not n^2 and at the same time it is not a constant due to it running the for and while loops in a exponential
                fashion in relation to the length of the array and the matter of how pre-sorted the values are.
